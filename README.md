# Decoder Ring
A decoder ring utilizing the caesar, polybius and substitution ciphers.

## Caesar
* You can encode a message or decode a message. 
* You will need to have a message, and a number for how big the shift will be on the 26 character english alphabet. Then check encode or decode accordingly.
* You cannot provide 0 or a negative number below -25 and cannot provide a shift larger than 25.
* This function will ignore capital letters but will retain spaces and alphanumeric characters.

## Polybius
* You can encode or decode a message using the Polybius Square.
* You will need to provide a message of even numbers to decode OR a message you want to encode and check encode or decode.
* Here to keep the 26 character alphabet in the shape of a square, have assigned "i" and "j" to the number 42.
* It will also return 42 for those two characters.
* This will ignore capital letters, but retain spaces.

## Substitution
* You can encode or decode a message using the substitution cipher!
* You will need to provide a message to encode or decode, a substition alphabet that you are using, and check encode/decode accordingly.
* The substituion alphabet MUST be required, must be exactly 26 characters long and cannot have duplicate characters within it.
* This will ignore capital letters but retain spaces whether encoding or decoding.
